# A better chess bot for discord
So.. one day I was playing chess on a discord bot (because why not), and I hated it. So I attempted to make a better one (in typescript)

## Usage
1) Add your token to `./src/data/config.json` where it says `YOUR-TOKEN-HERE`.

2) Run ```npm run build``` to build the typescript

3) Run ```npm run start``` to run the bot (MUST BE DONE AFTER STEP 2).


*Built off of a custom Typescript implementation of [GeraldCore](https://github.com/Elementalmp4/GeraldCore/blob/master/GeraldCore.js), so go check it out, or else... (i'm watching you)*
