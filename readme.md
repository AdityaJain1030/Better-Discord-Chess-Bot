# A better chess bot for discord
So.. one day I was playing chess on a discord bot (because why not), and I hated it. So I attempted to make a better one

## Usage
First add your token to `./src/data/config.json` where it says `YOUR-TOKEN-HERE`.
Then, you can run `npm run build` to build the typescript, and `npm run start` to run the bot (MUST BE DONE IN THIS ORDER).
Built off of a custom Typescript implementation of [GeraldCore](https://github.com/Elementalmp4/GeraldCore/blob/master/GeraldCore.js).
